Pay advance apps are designed to help you access your paycheck earlier than your expected deposit date. Due to the nature of this method, you’ll need to have a steady source of income. Regardless of your credit score, the more predictable your paycheck is, the more likely you will qualify for an advance.

A paycheck advance isn’t a loan, and there’s no interest charged. Most apps charge fees or require additional tips. The fees may seem small, but remember that a fee of $15 for a $500 cash advance is equivalent to an APR of nearly 36 percent.

Another factor to keep in mind: You will be drawing from your future income. This means a lower amount on your actual payday, which could make future bills harder to pay.
