Several online lenders offer personal loans for applicants with lower credit. They typically host a quick, streamlined application process on their website and offer lending decisions within minutes of submission. If approved for the loan, some will disburse the funds as soon as the same day, while it may take other lenders a few days before the direct deposit hits your bank account.

Given that there are a seemingly endless amount of lenders, it can be easy to get overwhelmed with the number of options. This is where an online lending network could help. Theyâ€™re online marketplaces that feature the details of different lenders based on category, making it easier to sift through and compare lenders.
